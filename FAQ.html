        <h2>What are Guidelines Included Premium Options?</h2>
        <p>The premium package features tabs such as "My Journal", which is where the user is able to type out their thoughts without someone accessing it and automatic help from a specific aid upon request.</p>
        <h2>What is Guidelines Included doing to protect their users identity?</h2>
        <p>Guidelines Included is making the app completely anonymous on the users half and only revealing the identity of the aid. It also provides an option to request password upon login which prohibits the entrance of anyone who does not have the password.</p>
        <h2>What is Guidelines Included doing to avoid the contact of outsiders in order to target other users?</h2>
        <p>Guidelines included is protecting its users from outsiders there to cause harm by only allowing the user to contact an aid such as a financial adviser and stay in direct contact with them. It never allows for intersection of two users.</p>
